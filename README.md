# Overview

ETLer is a comprehensive and highly customizable Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) framework designed for modern data pipelines. Built with Go, ETLer provides a set of powerful tools and abstractions to streamline the process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it to meet specific requirements, and loading it into target systems.

In today's data-driven world, ETL pipelines have become essential for organizations to harness the full potential of their data. ETLer aims to simplify and accelerate the development of these pipelines, enabling developers to focus on the core logic of data transformations while providing a robust and efficient runtime environment.
ETL pipelines play a crucial role in modern data architectures, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and 
machine learning (ML). As the volume, variety, and velocity of data continue to grow, the ability to efficiently extract, transform, and load data becomes paramount.

ETL pipelines enable organizations to:

- Consolidate data from disparate sources into a unified format
- Cleanse and validate data to ensure accuracy and consistency
- Transform data to meet the specific requirements of downstream systems
- Load data into target systems, such as data warehouses or AI/ML platforms
- Automate data workflows to reduce manual intervention and improve efficiency
- By leveraging ETL pipelines, organizations can ensure that their AI and ML models have access to high-quality, up-to-date, and relevant data, ultimately leading to more accurate insights and better decision-making.

## Key Features

- Modularity and Reusability: ETLer is designed with modularity and reusability at its core. The framework provides a set of building blocks, such as pipelines, stages, processors, converters, and loaders, which can be easily composed and reused across different ETL workflows. This modular approach enables developers to create complex data processing pipelines by combining and customizing these components to suit their specific requirements.

- Flexible Pipeline Definition: ETLer allows developers to define multi-stage data processing pipelines using a declarative and intuitive syntax. Stages can be configured to run in both synchronous and concurrent modes, providing flexibility in execution and optimizing performance based on the specific needs of the pipeline.

- Powerful Data Transformations:Transformations can be easily combined and chained together within stages to create complex data processing logic. The framework also allows developers to implement custom processors and converters using Go functions, providing unlimited flexibility in data manipulation.

- Efficient Data Loading: Loaders allows to efficiently load data from various sources, including files, databases, APIs, and message queues. Loaders are designed to handle different data formats and protocols, making it easy to integrate with diverse data sources. The framework also supports parallel data loading and provides options for controlling concurrency, enabling high-performance data extraction and loading.

- Comprehensive Observability: ETLer prioritizes observability and provides built-in features for monitoring, logging, and tracing pipeline execution. The framework exposes pipeline/stage/processor metrics using Golang's built-in batller tested `expvar` package, allowing easy integration with monitoring systems. Structured logging is powered by the `sypl` package, providing rich context and consistent log levels across the pipeline. Distributed tracing is supported through the `customapm` package which is powered under-the-hood by Elastic APM, enabling deep insights into pipeline performance and behavior.

- Error Handling and Resilience: ETLer includes robust error handling mechanisms to ensure pipeline resilience and fault tolerance. Errors that occur during pipeline execution are propagated and handled gracefully, with detailed error messages and proper error reporting. The framework also provides options for configuring retry policies, allowing automatic retries of failed operations with customizable backoff strategies.

- Testing and Documentation: ETLer emphasizes the importance of testing and documentation. The framework includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of pipeline components. The codebase is documented, with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of components facilitating adoption, and enable developers to effectively leverage the framework.

## Architectural Modularity and Flexibility

ETLer is designed with architectural modularity and flexibility in mind, leveraging Go's powerful features to create a highly extensible and customizable ETL framework.

The framework is built around a set of core interfaces, such as IPipeline, IStage, IProcessor, IConverter, and ILoader, which define the contracts for the various components of an ETL pipeline. These interfaces provide a clear separation of concerns and allow for easy composition and integration of custom implementations.

The framework provides optmized and default implementations for each component, such as Pipeline, Stage, Processor, Converter, and Loader, which can be used as-is or extended to meet specific requirements.

The use of Go's generic types enables the framework to handle various data types seamlessly. ETLer leverages generics to define type-safe data processing functions, making the framework highly adaptable to different data scenarios without sacrificing type safety.

ETLer also embraces the functional options pattern for configuration and customization. This pattern allows developers to configure pipeline components using a fluent and expressive syntax, providing a clean and flexible way to customize behavior without modifying the core structures.

The modular and flexible architecture of ETLer empowers developers to create highly customized and optimized ETL pipelines tailored to their specific data processing needs. The framework provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable ETL solutions while offering the freedom to extend and adapt the components to fit unique requirements.
